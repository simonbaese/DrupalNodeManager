# Drupal Node Manager

## Introduction

This is a project page for a node management module for Drupal 7. We currently use a highly customized version of this module. I will try to gradually present the workflow and features in a way that the code can be forked or used as an example. Please keep in mind that there are other well developed contributed modules such as Views to build overview pages for nodes.

## Specifications

This module helps to manage large quantities of nodes. It uses a table to list nodes with distinct administration options (such as change status, visibility, get field information, view node). It uses the Drupal form API to create interaction points. All interactions are processed with Drupal AJAX API. The elements are placed within the table with jQuery. The overview will support search, sorting and categorization by different properties.

## Setup

The setup is as simple as for a standard Drupal module. At the moment there are only dependencies on the core modules System, Taxonomy, Field and Node. I will post a more detailed description for the administration once the module is further in development.

## Examples

I will post example use cases here.

## Feedback and Support

If you would like to start a conversation please contact me at simon@youvo.org! Please do not open issues at the moment. Feel free to fork the project.

## Release Notes

There is no release date set yet. The module is subject to development.
